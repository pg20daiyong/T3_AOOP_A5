Instructions
Use you ArcadeGame of previous assignment or download "ArcadeGame.zip" and extract the project;
Create a new enemy Actor called AlienShip;

AlienShip starts the game with 3 HP.
AlienShip shots a bullet downwards while it is in the Shot state (shot cooldown is 1.5 seconds).
AlienShip randomly and slowly moves sideways while in Search state (it doesn't collide with asteroid, the collision shouldn't be accounted);

AlienShip runs away by moving upwards.
After an alien ship runs away, a new one is reborn after 5 seconds.
